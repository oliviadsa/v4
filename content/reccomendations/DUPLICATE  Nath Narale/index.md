I had the pleasure of working with Olivia and know her as a talented business analyst bringing insights to any project. She is skilled in the public healthcare domain, able to interpret information quickly and share her findings with all stakeholders. Her analytical skills enabled her to develop innovative solutions, especially in the use of social media channels and chatbots to create social impact and awareness. She has excellent communication and interpersonal skills, making her a great asset to any team.
